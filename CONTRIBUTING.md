## How Can I Contribute?

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

There are many ways in which you can participate in this project, including some that don't require you to write a single line of code.

- Report a bug
- Request a feature
- Write documentation, for users and contributors
- Contribute to the codebase

## Reporting Bugs

Did you find a bug? Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

**Before you create a new bug report, please do a search in open issues to check if the issue has already been reported.**

If you find your issue already exists, post relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Please use a reaction rather than posting a comment consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".

If you can't find an existing issue that describes your bug, create a new issue using the relevant issue form. Please include as many details as possible. The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

## Feature Requests

All feature requests are welcome, whether suggesting completely new features or minor improvements to existing functionality. Feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

**Before you create a new feature request, please do a search in open issues to check if the feature has already been suggested.**

If you find your feature request already exists, post relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Please use a reaction rather than posting a comment consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".

If you can't find an existing issue that describes your feature, create a new issue using the relevant issue form. Please include as much detail as possible, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

## Writing Documentation

You can help improve the documentation for this project by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. Please ensure that the pull request is limited to one type (bug fix, feature, docs etc.) and keep it as small as possible. You can create  multiple PRs instead of creating a huge one.

If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through the existing issues for something to work on.

1. Fork this project repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch
4. Make your changes and push those changes to GitHub
5. Create a pull request

When fixing a bug or adding features, it's good practice to add a test to demonstrate your fix or new feature behaves as expected. These tests should focus on one tiny bit of functionality and prove changes are correct.

If the change requires a change to the documentation, please update accordingly.
